# rock-paper-scissors

It is a very messy project, although I tried to make it as orderly as possible. It is the biggest project I have ever built so far. Below I will specify 1.what things I learned, 2.what things I struggled with, and 3.what mistakes I made.

1.I learned and tried in practice to add functionlaity and interactivity to my page with javascript. Namely, I learned to add event liteners and manipulate the DOM with their help. Also, I learned to incorporate logic written in javascript to the page through DOM manipulations

2.I struggled with a lot of things in this project. First, I spent too much time on UI (Note for myself for future: Do not spend much time on UI. Just make it decent looking and go on. UI doesnt matter much. You have to train the javascript problem solving more. Design is not that importnat at this stage). Second, I struggled with incorporating the logic into UI - mainly, I struggled with getting user input from UI. Third, I struggled with organization of files and directories. I tried organizing my code into modules and import and export my functions but the variables and functions kept intervening with each other and the page simply stopped working when I exported or imported code. This became so messy that I had to cut out some features I planned to add in the beginning(such as game leveling and choosing rpg characters) and restrusture the files to their original messy and disorganized state. I have to learn how to structure my projects in the future. That is incredibly important.

3.My main mistakes were: 1.Concentrating too much on the UI(already told about it above), 2.Bad variable naming(Believe me, it is painstakingly important to name your variables consistlently. Much of the pain and mess came from bad variable naming - I will never repeat that mistake again). 3.Not being patient enough to train my thinking skills. I must learn to think - to think like a programmer.

That's it. I make mistakes - I learn from mistakes. If you are reading this, learn from my mistakes.
And, remember:
Respect the woods. Be patient. Focus.
